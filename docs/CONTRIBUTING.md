## Folder Overview

```

/data/           → YAML files by framework (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
/examples/       → Sample use cases and data
/docs/           → This file, format spec, roadmap
/api/ (optional) → API to serve PII definitions (WIP)

````

## YAML Format Expectations

Please follow our [Data Format Specification](./data_format_spec.md), but here’s a quick summary:

- File name: `country.yaml` (e.g., `germany.yaml`)
- Structure:
  - `country`, `framework`, `version`, `status`, `categories[]`, `citations[]`
- Use valid field types: `direct_identifier`, `indirect_identifier`, `special_category`, etc.
- Include at least 3–5 categories with at least one legal citation

You can copy a template from `germany.yaml` or `france.yaml`.

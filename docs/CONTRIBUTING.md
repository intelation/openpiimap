## YAML Format Guidelines

> Use an existing country like `germany.yaml` as your template.

### Required fields:

* `country`, `framework`, `categories[]`
* Each category must include:

  * `name`, `type` (e.g., `direct_identifier`, `special_category`)
  * `required_masking` (true/false)
  * `citations[]` (article, law, or national regulation)

### Format Rules:

* YAML files must use **2-space indentation**
* **No tabs**, no trailing commas
* All tags should be present and non-empty (e.g., `tags: [biometric]`)
